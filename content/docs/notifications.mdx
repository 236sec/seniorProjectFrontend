# Notifications & Alerts

Never miss a trading opportunity by setting up custom price alerts. The **Notifications** page allows you to track specific coins and receive alerts when they hit your target prices.

## Creating a Notification

Follow these steps to create a new price alert:

1.  Navigate to the **Notifications** page.
2.  Click the **Add Notification** button.
3.  Fill in the notification details:
    - **Coin Name**: Select the cryptocurrency you want to track from the list.
    - **Alert Price**: Enter the specific price value for the alert.
    - **Condition**: Select the condition for the alert trigger:
      - `>=` (Price is greater than or equal to target)
      - `<=` (Price is less than or equal to target)
4.  Click **Save** to activate the notification.

## Understanding Status and Alerts

Your notification list displays the current status of each alert:

- **Coin Name**: The cryptocurrency being tracked.
- **Alert Price**: The target price you set.
- **Condition**: The rule (`>=` or `<=`) being applied.
- **Status**: Indicates if the alert is running.

> **Note**: When a notification condition is met and the user receives the alert, the notification status will automatically change to **Inactive**. To track the price again, you must create a new notification.

## Managing Notifications

### Deleting a Notification

You can remove notifications that are no longer needed:

1.  Locate the notification in your list.
2.  Click the **Delete** button associated with that notification.

### Editing Policy

Notifications **cannot be edited** after they are created. To change an alert (e.g., update the price or condition):

1.  **Delete** the existing notification.
2.  **Create** a new notification with the correct settings.
